# Fuck Off as a Service supybot plugin
## Overview
The concept is simple, some folks on IRC really do need to just be told off.  Why do it yourself
when supybot can do it for you?  Thanks to https://www.foaas.com/, now it can!

## Context
```
04:14:01 < innocent1> FOAAS (Fuck Off As A Service) provides a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common 
                    problem of telling people to fuck off.
04:14:18 <@innocent2> hahaha ,,,, *where*!?!?
04:14:46  * innocent2 found it :-D
04:16:15 <@innocent2> ecrist: ^^^  is that something we can add to vpnHelper when we want to /kickban people? :-P .... 
                 could save some typing :-P
07:16:09 <@ecrist> innocent2: I think I will actually write a supybot plugin for that
07:16:49 <@innocent2> ecrist: heh :) .... perhaps !fo (/kick) and !foban (/kickban) are more appropriate :-P
```
